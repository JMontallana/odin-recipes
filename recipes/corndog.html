    <h1>What is Corn Dog?</h1>
    <img src="../images/corndog.webp" alt="Corn Dog">
    <p>A corn dog is a sausage (usually a hot dog) that has been skewered, coated in a cornmeal batter, and deep-fried. A staple of American cuisine, the street food was likely invented by German immigrants in Texas in the 1920s.</p>
    <h3>Corn Dog Ingredients</h3>
    <p>These are ingredients you'll need to make this homemade corn dog recipe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cornmeal</strong> and <strong>flour:</strong> This corn dog batter starts with yellow cornmeal and all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A pinch of sugar lends a hint of sweetness.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder:</strong>  Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Salat</strong> and <strong>pepper:</strong> Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> A cup of milk adds moisture, ensuring a tender coating.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg gives the batter even more moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Fry the corn dogs in a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Beef frankfurters:</strong> This recipe calls for beef frankfurters, but you can use pork franks (or hot dogs) if you'd prefer.</li>
    </ul>
